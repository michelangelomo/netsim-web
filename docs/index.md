!!! warning "Vibe-Coded Project"
    This application has been built with a **"vibe-coding"** approach - prioritizing rapid development and experimentation over formal engineering practices. While the simulator is functional and useful for learning, please note:
    
    - 🎯 **Contributions Welcome**: We appreciate community contributions and improvements
    - 🔍 **Limited Review Capacity**: Due to the informal development approach, code reviews may be limited or delayed
    - 🍴 **Consider Forking**: For significant changes or customizations, consider forking the project to maintain your own version
    
    The project is open source under AGPL v3.0, so feel free to adapt it to your needs!
